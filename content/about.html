### Credo ###

The Journal for Occupied Studies is an independent contribution to the global
Occupy movement, one which springs from the New School for Social Research in
New York City but which fills its pages not only with student and faculty
perspectives on Occupy Wall Street but with contributions from diverse
individuals outside that university and indeed outside the USA. The JOS operates
for the radicalisation of this struggle, at the place between past and future,
theory and praxis. We hope the analyses and testimonies it offers valorize,
prolong, and intensify this fight, which did not begin with the 'American Fall',
and will not end with the decline of the call to 'Occupy!' specifically. The
editors of JOS intend the term 'occupied studies' to piggyback upon the moment
conjured by the word, or hash-tag, #occupy, whilst simultaneously raising the
question of our continuing situation as occupied bodies, yet to wrest control of
public space from the guardians of capital. Yes, documenting the thought/action
of the 'occupied', it is hoped, foments the occupation(s) still to come
