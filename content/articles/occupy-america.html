Movements always arrive unexpectedly. And those who have worked hardest in
previous years and months to push towards an escalation of struggles and
mobilizations are usually the most surprised by a movement's arrival. In spite
of the many surprises -- Who would have imagined that the occupation of Tahrir
Square was possible? Who would have imagined the Spanish _acampadas?_ -- Leftist
activists tend to insist in thinking that movements and the specific forms the
movements take can be predicted. The reality is that one can predict that there
will be a struggle, for class conflict is inscribed in the capitalist relations
of production. But when, where, and which form this struggle will take is
impossible to predict. The impossibility of predicting the specific
constellation in which those who are below decide that the situation is simply
not acceptable any longer does not mean that movements explode like lightening
in the sky.

Whereas a movement cannot be predicted, it can be prepared. The
patient daily work of organizing, the isolated struggles, the failed attempts at
action and mobilization, and their memory: all this is part of the preparation
of a movement. This preparation, however, does not function as a linear
quantitative growth which at a certain point will lead to the unavoidable birth
of a movement, in the way water boils when its temperature reaches 212 degrees
Fahrenheit. For a movement explodes when a certain amount of highly contingent
circumstances coincide to create the very specific situation in which fighting
becomes a credible option. And the movement grows when the forms of mobilization
are adequate to the specific social composition of those who are protesting.

### Some history ###

Occupy Wall Street began, unexpectedly, on September 17 with the occupation of
Zuccotti Park, a private park owned by the commercial real estate company
Brookfield Properties, in the Financial District, a few blocks away from Wall
Street. In fact, this was not the first occupation of the year. In the spring,
thousands of citizens and union members occupied the state capitol building in
Madison, Wisconsin for two weeks in order to protest against the austerity
program of the local governor, Scott Walker. Many hoped that this experience,
which combined a social struggle against neoliberal policies with the practice
of radical democracy, could expand to other cities across the United States. In
spite of the sympathies that the occupation in Madison attracted from all over
the country, however, this struggle did not start a movement. A few months
later, a network of unions, political organizations and local community
organizations, New York Against Budget Cuts, launched another campaign against
austerity policies and the crisis, starting an occupation near the City Hall,
called "Bloombergville".[^1]  While
Bloombergville attracted several hundred participants and became a focal point
for citywide opposition to cuts in education, health, and other social services,
it too did not manage to start a larger movement. Despite this, both the
occupation in Madison and Bloombergville helped prepare the ground for OWS, by
showing that protesting against the crisis was not only necessary, but possible,
and by importing the practice of the occupation of public spaces from Tahrir
Square into the United States.

OWS was launched out of a call by the magazine _Adbusters_, a "global network of
jammers and creatives"[^2], for hundreds of
activists to descend on Wall Street on September 17.  After the call, published
in a poster in the 97th issue of _Adbusters_ magazine, a general assembly of 150
people, activists of social networks and people not affiliated to any political
organization, was held in New York. The activists of the general assembly then
held a series of meetings during the summer to prepare the demonstration of
September 17.

On September 17, a few thousand people marched down to the Financial District:
after the police barricaded Wall Street, the march directed itself to Liberty
Street, where it held an assembly and started a semi-permanent encampment.
Around 100-200 people stayed the first night. During the first week of
occupation few on the left paid much attention to these protesters with no clear
demands and political identity (except a vague reference to Tahrir Square and
the Spanish _acampadas_), with no clear project in mind, almost all white, young
and middle class. The form of the movement initially left many quite cold and
suspicious: this was not what one would have expected and predicted. But
something started changing already the next Saturday, when the police beat
protesters who were marching uptown in a non authorized demonstration, used
pepper spray against some young female demonstrators and arrested around 80
people.  The completely unjustified violence employed by the NYPD finally
started drawing the general attention to this tiny occupation near Wall Street.
Other occupations were launched around the country, spreading like mushrooms in
cities coast-to-coast, from Boston to Los Angeles, from Austin to Chicago.
Hundreds of people went down to see what was happening in Zuccotti Park and to
take part in the general assemblies and working groups. The following Saturday,
on September 1, another march, on the Brooklyn Bridge, was organized in order to
protest against police repression: this time more than 5000 people took part in
the demonstration. This day the NYPD made a fatal mistake: 700 people, who were
marching on the roadway of the Brooklyn Bridge blocking the traffic, were
arrested and carried off the bridge on ten buses. The attitude of the NYPD in
both cases and throughout the following weeks reflected a break with the tactics
employed by the American police towards social movements until the Seattle
anti-WTO demonstrations of 1999. Since Seattle, police efforts to frustrate
activists are usually characterized by attempts to isolate movements and
struggles, and to prevent them from spreading: the panoply of police tactics
consists of forcing people to demonstrate only on the sidewalks, putting
barricades between one sector of the demonstration and another in order to block
any communication and mobility between the different sectors, isolating the
demonstration from the rest of the city, and quickly arresting demonstrators --
often forcefully or violently -- who are perceived to be in the slightest
violation of the rules. The enormous popular disgust evoked by the NYPD's mass
arrest on the Bridge pushed the unions to take position in support of the
movement. Three days later, on October 5, a massive march was organized in
support of OWS by a network of unions, among them SEIU 1199 (healthcare),
AFL-CIO, CWA 1109 (telecommunication), RWDSU (trade), Transport Workers Unions
(which organizes the workers of the NYC subway), and a range of community
organizations, including the Alliance for Quality Education, New York
Communities for Change, Coalition for the Homeless, and the NYC Coalition for
Educational Justice.  Students from some of the biggest campuses of New York
also supported the march, organizing a walk out of 2000 students and then
proceeding downtown to join the unions.

By October 15, the date of the international day of action of the "indignados"
and of the antiwar days of protest in the States, protests had spread in more
than 200 cities across the country. Police repression spread at the same pace.
In Times Square, where thousands of people gathered for hours, police attacked
the protesters with horses and arrested 40 people in the square, arresting 70 in
total during the day. 175 people were arrested in Chicago and 100 in Arizona.
But it is Occupy Oakland which suffered the most brutal repression by the
police, ten days later. In the early morning of October 25, the Democratic mayor
of the city, "worried" for the safety of the citizenry, ordered the Oakland
police to evict the occupation, which had started on October 10 in front of the
City Hall. The occupiers responded to the eviction by organizing a mass rally in
the evening in order to occupy the space again: they were attacked and dispersed
with tear gas by police officers in riot gears, 120 arrests followed.  In the
midst of that attack, Scott Olsen, an Iraq War veteran and member of Veterans
for Peace, had his skull fractured by a tear gas projectile. The particular
violence of the eviction was proportional to the peculiar political and social
radicalism of Occupy Oakland. Oakland, a city of the San Francisco Bay Area,
near the campus of Berkeley, has a long history of struggle. This is the city in
which a general strike paralyzed production for 54 consecutive hours in 1946;
where the movement of the Black Panthers was born; where in 2003 the dock
workers shut down the port in order to block the ships which were sailing to
Iraq. On October 19 the general assembly of Occupy Oakland passed a resolution
in which it declared that it would actively support all strikes, both those
organized by unions and wildcat strikes, of workers and students in the San
Francisco Bay Area. That this declaration was not just a matter of words became
clear on November 2nd, when Occupy Oakland called for a general strike in
response to police repression. General strikes in the United States have been
banned since 1947 by terms of the Taft-Hartley bill: workers who break this law
can be punished with immediate firing or arrest. This is why Occupy Oakland
suggested on its website several ways of taking part in the general strike: 

> "We are asking that all workers go on strike, call in sick, take a vacation
> day or simply walk off the job with their co-workers. We are also asking that
> all students walk out of school and join workers and community members in
> downtown Oakland. All banks and large corporations must close down for the day
> or demonstrators will march on them [...] Occupy Oakland recognizes that not
> all workers, students and community members will feel able to strike all day
> long on November 2, and we welcome any form of participation which they feel
> is appropriate. We urge them to join us before or after work or during their
> lunch hours."[^3]

</blockquote>

The results of the November 2nd general strike were astonishing:
not only the banks downtown and the schools were shut down, but the march of
20,000 people managed to shut down the port for a couple of hours, with the
support of the rank and file workers of ILWU, who organized wild cat strikes in
different sectors of the port through the entire day. Another port blockade,
this time endorsed by several Occupy on the West Coast, was launched by Occupy
Oakland a month later, on December 12th. The general strike of November 2nd,
organized within only six days by Occupy Oakland, and its sequel with the port
blockade of December 12th garnered support from the occupations in other cities
across the country, which also launched marches and actions in solidarity with
Oakland. But besides the solidarity among the occupations, the general strike in
Oakland and the port blockade in the West Coast not only mark the most concrete
radical action undertaken by the movement, they also open the possibility of an
intensification of the strategic direction of the movement. What Occupy Oakland
managed to do, indeed, goes beyond the simple interaction between the movement
and unions, which also characterizes other experiences in other cities. By
calling for a general strike, Occupy Oakland managed to become something more
than a cousin to the struggles organized by somebody else, and positioned itself
to become a touchstone for ongoing struggles in many cities. It became the very
propulsive center of the struggle, and forced the major unions to support the
strike, at least in words, if not in facts. In this sense the general strike of
November 2nd and the port blockade set a possible model to be exported in the
other cities: a model that pushes the occupy movement to pass to a further
stage, to become the propulsive starting point for a new season of social
struggles.

### Democracy or consensus? ###

With slight differences the movement has adopted similar organizational forms
everywhere. These forms can be summarized in the following way: decisional
centrality of the general assembly, open to everybody and run by facilitators
through the method of consensus or large majority; proliferation of working
groups whose decisions are reported and discussed in the general assembly;
refusal -- implicit or explicit -- of any kind of representative democracy;
adoption in some cases of spokes councils, composed by spokespersons for every
working group, who rotate at every meeting and do not have any decisional
mandate. This organizational form has been adopted in particular by the OWS
movement in NYC, where within a month approximately 75 different working groups
have been created -- from Buddhist meditation to the drummers, from labor to
education, outreach and media. To understand the centrality of the issue of
democracy within the movement it is not sufficient to look at its social
composition or at the strength of the anarchist tradition in the United States.
In fact, if at the beginning the social composition of the occupation in
Zuccotti Park was mainly middle class, it started changing quite soon and should
in any case be understood in light of the role played by organized labor at
least starting from October 5th. Moreover, the initial occupiers and the group
of facilitators who were de facto running the occupation were not all
anarchists, but came from a diversity of political traditions. This is not to
say that these elements played no role, but to say rather that their presence is
not sufficient to explain why democracy is so central. Another element to take
into consideration is that the centrality of the issue of democracy is not a
characteristic of the American movement alone, but has strongly characterized at
least also the Spanish _acampadas_ as well, and is a general feature of social
movements in recent years. This most likely represents, at least partially, a
reaction to the progressive shift of decisional power towards executive
institutional bodies or extra-political organisms. If this process has already
characterized the European institutional and political dynamic for the last
twenty years -- it suffices to mention the procedure adopted during the European
Constitution -- it is also important to note that the United States, the
mythological land of democracy and freedom, in fact has one of the least
democratic representative systems found in Western countries (not to speak of
its rapidly growing economic inequality). The very act of the OWS movement's
self-definition as a leaderless movement, which was prominently asserted from
the beginning on the OWS website and by the occupiers themselves, carries with
it a decisive criticism of the substantial lack of democracy in the United
States, where even the election of union officials is based on personal
leadership.

While this new attention to horizontal democracy could have extremely positive
effects on the reconstruction of social movements in the United States, the
fetishism of democratic, consensual procedures could also have a paralyzing
effect. Indeed, in New York, after almost two months of occupation, discussion
of decision-making processes has increasingly replaced political discussion both
in the general assemblies and in the newly-formed spokes council. In the
spasmodic search for the alchemic combination between the most possible
democratic organization and the efficiency necessary to catalyze the movement,
politics has been lost in translation,  falling into a self-referential spiral.
While this focus on direct democracy can be explained also by the attempt to
maintain the political autonomy of the movement against every attempt at
external cooptation, the result has been the almost paranoid focus on procedural
detail and organizational minutiae. This attitude, being fundamentally
time-consuming, ultimately becomes more exclusive than inclusive.  It
automatically excludes all those who do not have the time to take part in
interminable discussions surround, in the end, minor concrete implications for
they need to reproduce their life. Moreover, the difficulty of reaching wider
political decisions and of elaborating a political strategy through this method,
gives the opportunity to traditional political and labor organizations to
strategize and take the initiative. The practice of consensus tends to cultivate
the illusion of an impossible homogeneity, which would be counterproductive even
if it were realized, for it would limit the diversity of the ways in which
class, race and gender interests can be represented in a political position or
decision. If, as Daniel Bensaïd pointed out, politics is more similar to algebra
than arithmetic, this is because it is based on a constant disequilibrium, in
which negative numbers must also be included in one's calculations. Majority
vote, instead than consensus, takes into account this disequilibrium. Instead of
trying to reduce decisions to an impossible synthesis, leaves open the
possibility of a persistent, and even organized, dissent, without for this
reason paralyzing the decision making.

In these cases Democracy has been confused with consensus, which itself has been
confused with procedure. In the end the consensus procedure has been divorced
from its content or rather it has become its own content. The point, however,
would be to treat democracy not as an abstract organizational form, but rather
as a process of empowerment of specific social actors, who find their own way to
organize themselves and let their voices be herd, in the middle of the struggle
and through the struggle. The question then becomes political once again:
Democracy for whom, to arrive where, and to obtain what?  

### Unions and OWS ###

The future dynamic of the movement largely depends on its capacity to spread
outside the occupied square and to propel social struggles in schools, working
places and neighborhoods. Contrary to what happened to the Seattle movement,
most unions decided to support the OWS movement very quickly.  Their decision to
embrace the occupation reflected the realization by union leaders in New York
and around the country that the movement was having a significant impact on the
national political debate by coalescing popular anger around issues of class
inequality, budget cuts, and mass unemployment.  It has also shifted mainstream
political discussions, intensifying opposition against attacks on labor. The
support Unions have offered to the movement has not been merely formal: several
powerful unions have offered the use of spaces, money, food and supplies, and
health care. The collaboration between unions and OWS led first to the
demonstration of October 5th and then to the national day of action on November
17th. Moreover, AFL-CIO actively mobilized its members in order to protect the
occupation from the first attempt at eviction ordered by mayor Bloomberg. Among
the working groups in Zuccotti Park a labor working group was also organized:
this working group, in which many union members took part, supported the
campaign of Sotheby's workers against Sotheby's attempt to eliminate union
rights. All these elements are certainly positive and have opened the
possibility for a new empowerment of workers all over the country. However, the
fact of securing union support for the movement does not guarantee a change of
unions' tactics moving in the direction of internal democracy, and the
escalation of concrete labor struggles. Particularly in New York, the movement
has encountered some difficulty in actively organizing initiatives of support of
workers' struggles, beyond a formal endorsement. 

Finally, a more general problem concerns the capacity of the movement to take
the initiative and somehow determine the political and social agenda. The
Oakland experience showed the possibility of pushing the unions to radicalize
their positions and to support, at least formally, the general strike. OWS in
New York, however, did not show the same capacity of political initiative. Also
the response given to the eviction from Zuccotti Park ordered by Bloomberg on
November 15th was not as effective and as radical as the response in Oakland.
Evicted from the park, being prohibited to use tents or to sleep in the park
after 11pm, the occupation seemed to have lost momentum and did not manage to
escalate the struggle or to spread occupations. The demonstration of November
17th, mostly promoted by the unions, saw a massive participation of thousands of
people. However, entirely controlled by union leaders, it reproduced the most
conventional forms of protest. Shortly before the demonstration, the president
of SEIU, Mary Key Henry, publicly announced her endorsement for Obama in the
next presidential elections: "We need a leader willing to fight for the needs of
the 99 percent... Our economy and democracy have been taken over by the
wealthiest one percent". As pointed out by Glenn Greenwald<sup><a
		href="#foot4">[4]</a></sup>, Henry's endorsement of Obama is an attempt to
pretend that the protest is grounded on the belief that the Republicans are the
party of the wealthy, whereas the Democrats stand for the working class. The
consequence of this public endorsement became visible already on November 17th.
SEIU 1199 clearly tried to control the messaging of the protest, for example by
bringing a huge Jumbotron and blaring sound system, which replace the people's
mic, and even more significantly, by actively preventing a real occupation of
the Brooklyn Bridge by actually blocking the traffic. What happened on November
17th signifies that the movement is now at a crucial turning point. The practice
of consensus alone is not a sufficient antidote to ward off co-optation by the
Democratic Party: the only antidote would be the capacity of the movement to
elaborate an autonomous political strategy and to escalate and spread the
struggles.

### The students and OWS ###

At the end of November 17th it was still not clear what dynamic the movement
would or should take. Something, however, happened just one hour before the
unions' march: a sector of the students' demonstration, which was heading to
Union Square, occupied one of the buildings of a progressive but expensive
private university, The New School. This was the first occupation of a
university building within the OWS movement. The American system of education is
known worldwide for its deep iniquity. In the last thirty years the dominance of
private education over public universities has drastically increased.  Between
2001 and 2006 tuition has increased 56%, each American student has an average of
$24,000 debt with the total amount of the student debt hitting 805 billion: this
is an amount comparable to that which led to the subprime crisis. The rate of
insolvency is now around 10%, and it is clear that it will only continue to
increase, as a result of the increasing rate of unemployment and
underemployment. The enormous cuts to public education and increase in tuition
both in private and in public education are leading to an increasingly
systematic exclusion of working class children and people of color from higher
education.  Students had already started organizing themselves by the beginning
of October. In NYC they created an All Student City Assembly in which students
from NYU, Columbia, New School, Cooper Union, Julliard, Pratt, and CUNY took
part. CUNY is NYC's public university, a truly giant institution with nearly
half a million students and dozens of colleges planted throughout the city.
During the month of October the All Student Assembly organized dozen of events,
including a People's University and a week of student action from November 14th
to November 21st. The main target of the week of action was the protest against
the tuition hikes at CUNY and against student debt, with the launch of a
campaign based on four principles: 1) Student loans should be interest-free; 2)
Public colleges and universities should be federally-funded and tuition-free; 3)
Private and for-profit colleges and universities, which are largely financed
through student debt, should open their books; 4) The current student debt load
should be written off. The answer by the police in NYC as in the rest of the
country has been characterized, once again, by an excess of brutality. While on
November 21st police attacked the students peacefully demonstrating at the
Baruch College, CUNY, and arrested 25 students, some days earlier police
brutalized students and faculty at Berkeley; shortly after, shocking images of
the repression against the students of UC Davis, near Sacramento, California,
circulated rapidly on websites, newspapers, and mailing lists throughout the
whole world. Called for by the Chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi, the police attacked
the students peacefully protesting on campus in order to evict the occupation
and pepper-sprayed the students who sat on the floor and refused to leave. As
Nathan Brown, an Assistant Professor at UC Davis, recounted in an open letter in
which he demanded the resignation of the Chancellor: "Police used batons to try
to push the students apart. Those they could separate, they arrested, kneeling
on their bodies and pushing their heads into the ground. Those they could not
separate, they pepper-sprayed directly in the face, holding these students as
they did so. When students covered their eyes with their clothing, police forced
open their mouths and pepper-sprayed down their throats. Several of these
students were hospitalized. Others are seriously injured. One of them,
forty-five minutes after being pepper-sprayed down his throat, was still
coughing up blood".[^5]

The repression suffered by Californian students led only to an expansion and
escalation of the movement. A GA of 5000 students in December passed a
resolution in favor of a national day of student action, on March 1st: the call
for the day of action was then modified and endorsed by the NYC Student Assembly
and started circulating among campuses and gathering endorsement and support
around the country.

Coordinating and unifying the student movement, however, is no simple task. The
division between private and public universities is also a division between
middle class, predominantly white students and students coming from working
class families, with a higher rate of people of color. In order to push in
direction of a nationwide student movement it would be necessary to bring
forward a unifying platform grounded on the overarching idea of free education
for everybody and on the critique of the current American system of education
including its reproduction of divided class relations and race and gender
inequalities; to build the solidarity of the students of private universities
towards those of public universities; and to create effective forms of
coordination among the different struggles and occupations.

### Conclusion ###

<blockquote class='pull'>
	After two centuries of social struggles we should have learned that there is
	no spring awaiting the movement, for the only spring is the movement itself.
</blockquote>

The OWS movement took place after years of absence of cohesive nationwide
movements and amidst an extreme fragmentation of struggles. The economic crisis
and the evident iniquity of the austerity policies implemented by the government
created the conditions for a new social explosion. The first great merit of the
OWS movement is that it provided an answer to the danger of the rise of a racist
and libertarian right, which is always a possible outcome of any economic
crisis. It also allowed a reconnection between these fragmented struggles to
emerge again and give visibility to a plurality of experiences of resistance and
protest which, in their isolation of the last decade, remained muted by the
noise of mainstream politics. The winter has arrived, and the presidential
elections are now approaching. This is the moment in which the movement needs to
rethink itself. Rethinking itself does not mean withdrawing from the squares and
taking a break until the spring, as the magazine Adbusters seemed to suggest on
November 14th: "Then we clean up, scale back and most of us go indoors while the
die-hards hold the camps. We use the winter to brainstorm, network, build
momentum so that we may emerge rejuvenated with fresh tactics, philosophies, and
a myriad projects ready to rumble next spring"<sup><a
		href="#foot6">[6]</a></sup>  After two centuries of social struggles we
should have learned that there is no spring awaiting the movement, for the only
spring is the movement itself. It is not fortuitous that in January, the most
interesting and innovative political statement, this time in support of a
general strike for May 1st came from Occupy Oakland, which precisely did not
take a break, but on the contrary resisted every attempt at repression and
isolation of the movement, constantly trying to escalate the struggle. Besides
the discussion on the question of the existence of the concrete conditions to
call for a general strike or not on a national level, the political reasoning
articulated in this statement grasps a crucial point: the relation between
structural changes in the class composition of the last decades and the forms of
the struggle. As the statement reads: "In 2011, the number of unionized workers
in the US stood at 11.8%, or approximately 14.8 million people. What these
figures leave out are the growing millions of people in this country who are
unemployed and underemployed. The numbers leave out the undocumented, and
domestic and manual workers drawn largely from immigrant communities. The
numbers leave out workers whose workplace is the home and a whole invisible
economy of unwaged reproductive labor. The numbers leave out students who have
taken on nearly $1 trillion dollars in debt, and typically work multiple jobs,
in order to afford skyrocketing college tuition.  The numbers leave out the huge
percentage of black Americans that are locked up in prisons or locked out of
stable or secure employment because of our racist society".[^7]  The question is
not to oppose unionized workers to non-unionized workers and unemployed people,
but rather to rethink what a strike means in a situation in which the class
composition and the concrete organization of labor has radically changed, in
which unemployed and underemployed people, women and people of color represent
an increasing large part of the working class, and in which the processes of
subjectification of the working class are not the same we have known in the
past. This implies reimagining different ways in which production and
circulation of commodities can be blocked, including the possibility of variable
forms of participation to the strike, and rethinking the sites of democratic
empowerment of the working class.

The Oakland example shows in practice that the question of combining the event
of the social rebellion and the laborious work of organizing, coordinating,
keeping a memory alive, and transmitting experience when the movement recedes is
a matter of combining together two different, discordant temporalities: the
urgent time of the movement and the slower time of continuity . Such work is not
an easy task, although it is a necessary task. But combining these two
temporalities does not mean freezing the time of the movement, with the
assumption that it will be possible to simply restart it again at a later time.
In order to rethink itself this movement needs to spread, to go outside of the
squares, to invade all aspects of the reproduction of capitalist relations.  In
a word: to escalate.
