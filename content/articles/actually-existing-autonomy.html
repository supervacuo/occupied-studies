Over the course of the last several decades the view that states in the advanced
capitalist world could be meaningfully challenged (and perhaps even taken over)
by organized segments of their own populations has come to seen as far-fetched
in the extreme. According to Neil Smith (2009: 51), the plausibility of
revolutionary transformation has not only slipped out of political fashion, it
has been banished to the "infinite horizon of never-never land." If the
university was once a hotbed of revolutionary ambition, it too seems to have
suffered the same fate as the broader culture. To many of our generation (in
diapers as Margaret Thatcher announced that there would no longer be any
alternative) the revolutionary upheavals of 1968 seem an impossible fairy tale.
That students were at the fore of a movement that brought the French state to
the brink of collapse, for example, is almost unimaginable to those of us who
came of age during "the plagues of Reagan and Bush" (to borrow a phrase from Ani
Difranco). I studied at institutions that were ignited by the energy of
anti-globalization agitation but students were never the driving force behind
those movements. North American campuses were a key source of the thousands of
foot soldiers that struggled in Seattle or Quebec City but much of the critical
organizing was done by networks and organizations that had no explicit links to
university communities. I think it is fair to say that over the course of the
last the four decades Anglo-American universities have ceased to be generative
hubs of radical agitation. Of course, I am not suggesting that the university is
somehow outside of the broader political economy and therefore should be
expected to be a key source of challenge to the status quo. But neither do we
want to dismiss that universities remain institutions where a certain amount of
experimentation is still possible, where some opportunities to enter into
engagements that are "discontinuous with the universalizing telos of capital"
(Meyerhoff et al 2011: 484-85) still may exist.

In recent months, there have been signs that the Anglo-American university's
long winter of political inertia may moving towards a thaw. Recent eruptions in
places where meaningful confrontations seemed unimaginable only a few years ago
have restored some of our optimism about university-centered politics. The
impressive mobilizations that engulfed campuses across the University of
California system in September of 2009 offer one example of what I mean. There,
students, faculty, and campus workers responded to dramatic tuition fee hikes
and employee lay-offs with a coordinated fightback that brought demonstrations
and occupations to campuses up and down the Californian coast, from Los Angeles
to Berkeley, from Santa Cruz to Fullerton. More recently, the wave of agitation
that has shaken the United Kingdom seems to offer even more evidence that
universities are once again becoming key sites of opposition. Last November's
large and dramatic protests demonstrated an impressive will to confront the
ConDem coalition's austerity program in general and its proposal to treble
tuition fees in particular.

	waiting for"
</blockquote>

Yet while I am heartened by the potency of these and other mobilizations it is
critical to remind ourselves that they have all been defensive efforts to
preserve the status quo in the face of bold new incursions from the right. And
while I recognize that these are critical campaigns my intention here is to look
away from strictly preservationist efforts and examine a few struggles aimed at
transforming particular aspects of the university. To be clear, I am not
interested in drawing a surgical line between "defensive" and "offensive"
battles as if the two were not always already linked. I recognize the paramount
importance of fighting back when we are attacked. But I also think it is useful
to highlight some of the ways that people inside the university have been able
to carve out new kinds of autonomy. Neoliberalization is a process that works in
and through already inherited political traditions (Theodore and Brenner 2002)
and I believe that some of the key forms of resistance to that process will also
work through already existing forms.

I have been very interested in ongoing debates about what an "autonomous"
university could look like and the kinds of strategies that particular groups
and individuals have taken up in efforts to forge actually existing autonomies
within increasingly neoliberalized institutions. This paper starts from the
premise that "we are the people we have been waiting for" and seeks to highlight
a few areas in which university-based activists have begun to fight back. In
what follows I highlight three such strategies in an effort to show how they
might be prefigurative of an autonomous university to come. While each one is
certainly limited in its disruptive capacity and -- on its own -- poses no
serious threat to the existing order of things, it seems that taken together --
along with other forms of struggle and dissent -- broader kinds of reclamation
might yet become possible. I offer these examples not to privilege them above
others but simply to highlight three nodes in what I hope will become a broader
circulation of struggles within the university. With this in mind, I begin by
looking at new forms of assembly that have emerged as efforts to challenge the
top-down governance structures of our universities. Next I look at how
"militant" research strategies have been engaged as new ways to radicalize the
production of knowledge. Finally, I highlight some of the efforts that have been
made to wrest academic knowledge production from the hands of corporate
publishers. Our discussion begins with a brief gloss on the lay of the land
(what I am calling the "brave new world of higher education") and a quick
explanation of how I am using the notion of a "circulation of struggles."

### The Brave New World of Higher Education ###

The university, like most public institutions, has been profoundly reconfigured
by the creative destruction of neoliberalization. The roll-back (Peck and
Tickell) of stable state funding for public universities has been accompanied by
a roll-out of skyrocketing fees for access, a new emphasis on public/private
cooperation schemes and an instrumentalizaiton of curricula, all administered by
an increasingly contingent work force. This reconfiguration of higher education
has been marked by what the Edufactory Collective has called the "Double
Crisis". By this, they mean the acceleration of the crisis specific to the
university -- that which results from outdate disciplinary divisions and funding
models, its "eroded epistemological status"[^edufactory] -- and the
crisis of post-Fordist conditions of labour and value -- the commodification of
knowledge and the immeasurability of this knowledge. These crises and the
subsumption of the university to capital signifies the decisive end of the New
Deal for Education, the blurring of distinctions between a private and a public
institution, and the opening of universities as the site of the imposition of
austerity and control over academic workers -- students, faculty, and the
precariously employed. In fact, as Marc Bousquet has argued, the university has
become the paradigmatic site for new instantiations of capital, the "leading
innovator in the production and engineering of lousy forms of employment that
have gutted the global economy"[^bousquet]. The university is "a
laboratory for the 'capture' of value, or what it refers to as 'human, social,
and cultural capital'"[^bousquet].

But simultaneously the university is also a powerful laboratory for experiments
that will shape not only struggles around higher education, knowledge and
academic freedom, but will also forge new alliances between students and labour.
The university is the cookshop of future, broad-based movements that challenge
not just capital's imposition on the instruments of higher learning, but
capital's imposition on every facet of the social realm. In fact, as George has
suggested elsewhere, student movements as they have arisen can be seen as the
main arm of anti-austerity struggles, and the strongest response to the global
economic crisis -- Occupy Wall Street notwithstanding. But, how these struggles
-- and the three proposals we will bring forward to circulate these struggles --
will in fact circulate in and through the university requires a brief
elaboration on the concept of "circulation of struggles".

This concept comes out of the Operaist or Autonomist tradition, developed out of
a class struggle reading of Marx's circuit of capital from Volume Two of his
tome, Capital. Capitalism, Marx noted, as a system for the accumulation of
surplus value, operates on a circuit. Capital transubstantiates from commodity
into money which commands the acquisitions of further resources to be
transformed into more commodities. The circuit is expressed as M -- C...P...C'
-- M'. Money (M) is used to purchase commodities (C) labour, machinery and raw
materials, that are thrown into production (P) to create new commodities (C')
that are sold for more money (M'). Part of that -- the prime in M', is retained
as profit and part of it is used to purchase more means of production to make
more commodities[^marx][^cleaver]. As Nick Dyer-Witheford says of
this process -- one then rinses and repeats. This is the circulation of capital.
It is self-generating, auto-catalytic, a "constantly revolving circle in which
every point is simultaneously one of departure and return"[^dyer-witheford].

We are to think, here, of a rotating sphere that is not only accelerating in
velocity as it speeds through the circulatory processes but is expanding in
diameter as it fills more and more social and geographic space. This is the
image of global capital, and the university is not outside this sphere. It is in
it, and in fact, as Edu-Factory and others argue, it has become fundamental to
the speed and expansion of this sphere. But the circulation of capital is also
the circulation of struggle, as Harry Cleaver and Peter Bell pointed
out[^cleaver-2] shining lights on the fissures that appear at every
node, at every moment in the circulation of capital; each space between a letter
(the dash between M and C, the dots between C and P) indicate that the
"circulation process is interrupted"[^marx] and provide possible
moments of breakdown. This counter-circulation, the circulation of struggles, is
the way Cleaver and Bell suggest we can begin to see the circuit of capital
operationalised as resistance.

<blockquote class='pull'>
	Though abstracted from a direct relationship to the circulation of capital,
	there is a true sense of circulation of struggle at work here.
</blockquote>

As a very brief example: the attempt to purchase the commodity labour (M-C)
could be interrupted by struggles over the dispossession of populations from the
land necessary to create disposed proletarians; the moment of production can be
interrupted by workplace resistances whether in the form of organised strikes or
more subtle activities. The conversion of commodities to money (C-M) can be
interrupted by theft, but weak markets, by public appropriation. When struggle
erupts at one flashpoint there is, due to capital's circulatory nature, the
possibility of these struggles igniting other struggles elsewhere in the
circuit. This de-centred the classical Marxist focus on the immediate point of
production, without relinquishing entirely the concept of anti-capitalist
struggle -- and rather expanding it. It opens up struggle into a wider orbit,
potentially offering the interlinking of struggles and the development of the
thus far imperfectly theorised multitude. It helps to think, for a moment here,
of the circulation of struggles happening right now across the world, ignited
perhaps by the resistances in North Africa, Greece, the UK, Wisconsin and now
from Wall Street to 200 towns across the US and Canada. Though abstracted from a
direct relationship to the circulation of capital, there is a true sense of
circulation of struggle at work here.

### The New Assemblies ###

So, our first proposal for the prefiguring of the autonomous university fits
along this circuit, and seeks to give structure to this multitude and a location
for the beginnings of resistance to the top-down bureaucratic administration of
the university. This structure is that of the assembly, which is a different
proposition than creating a union, either of staff, faculty or of students. The
majority of the problems we encounter within the university are the same as
those experienced in any other workplace -- they stem from the fact that we sell
our labour power to the university. A contribution to changing these problems
would result from changes in the balance of power in the workplace. In order to
radically alter the balance of power an organisation is required which seeks to
exercise power in the workplace, and against that workplace, against the
processes of valorisation that mark it. So, instead of attempting to evacuate
the contemporary university to create an alternative, the autonomous university,
from without but which creates the same use values just not on the same economic
model, the assembly seeks to exert power over the existing institution, and to
change it fundamentally, making the autonomous university from within. We
propose the "assembly" as the form which these organised resistances to the
existent balance of power would take.

Assemblies have become key, of late, in the organisation of movements around the
globe. Used from Greece to Spain, Egypt to Wisconsin and here in New York, the
assembly provides a space for collective decision making, a horizontality that
simultaneously is the creation of structure. A precedent for the current rise in
assembly-politics does exist: there have been organisational forms which, in
their very construction, resist the top-down politicking of parties, vanguards
and parliamentarianism. In particular, Spain in the late 1970s saw the rise of a
workers' assembly movement which described itself as the "independent
manifestation of the proletariat" [^amoros] and served as a physical
confirmation of the class struggle in that country. The assembly is a process of
self-education and expansion, but does away with the pure spontaneity and
structurelessness that has marked previous attempts at horizontality.

The University of Toronto General Assembly offers us an example of this
resistance to -- and confrontation with -- the neoliberal university. Formed in
the fall of 2010, the General Assembly is made up of students, faculty, staff,
alumni and community members targeting the corporatised and undemocratic
governance structures within the institution, and pushes back against those
structures, attempting to rebuild and restructure the university as an
autonomous space from within.

Following the example of many European university actions, the Assembly
membership is broad and inclusive, having undergraduates, food service workers,
clerical staff, as well as the requisite graduate students and faculty as active
members. All attendees at the assembly meetings are able to vote on motions, and
all become stakeholders in the project for the radical transformation of the
university, specifically, but for the transformation of our understanding of
education, knowledge, and labour practices more broadly. The specific focus of
the U of T GA is centred around an anti-corporatisation campaign, but the work
extends to accountability and governance issues, international solidarity and
student-worker solidarity.

The membership of the General Assembly are the "human know-how" that permits the
university to operate,and the specialised knowledge they possess also permits
them to resist. Their particular position here is used to agitate against the
particular imposition of capital into universities and raises the question as to
the limits to capitalist expansion, and the possibility and imaginings of a
post-capitalist future.

The formation of the U of T General Assembly can be seen as a confrontation with
cognitive capitalism by those who make their living instantiating knowledge. The
impetus for the Assembly was the examination of the deal the University of
Toronto has made with Peter Munk, owner of Barrick Gold mining company, who will
have an entire school -- The Munk School of Global Affairs -- created in his
name. The Assembly agitates against the funding -- specifically against the
provisions in the funding which give a great deal of decision making power to
the Munk board around curriculum and learning outcomes. In fact, "the school's
director will be required to report annually to a board appointed by Munk to
'discuss the programmes, activities and intiatives of the School in greater
detail'" -- but also this project attempts to connect broadly the undemocratic
nature of capitalist expropriation of resources and the outsourcing of misery
for private profit and gain. The assembly-form, in this specific instance, but
also in general, offers a body to the resistance, and creates pressure on one of
the key nodes in the circulation of capital through the university -- the
transformation of Money into the Commodity of education. Through its democratic
format we can begin to see how one could administer the autonomous university --
with collective decision-making power placed in the hands of those most involved
in the existence of the university itself.

### Militant Research Strategies ###

<blockquote class='pull'>
	Conricerca is itself a practice of intellectual production that does not
	accept a distinction between active researcher and passive research subject.
</blockquote>

The work of the U of T General Assembly in exposing, building community and
subjectivities around the Munk deal can be seen as another way to circulate the
struggles of the University, we proffer this as the second tool for the
prefiguring of the autonomous university -- what has been called variously,
militant research and co-research or, in Italian, conricerca. Both grow out of
the long history of "inquiries" as developed by both Marx and Engels in the 19th
C. Militant research and conricerca differ slightly, but both see themeslves not
simply as research but as political action. Conricerca (or co-research) was
developed in Italy in the 1960s mostly by Romano Alquati and the young activists
writing in the militant journals Quaderno Rossi and Classe Operai, and sought to
understand the struggles of factory workers and students not as sociological
knowledge, but as a political tool for the expansion and circulation of
struggle. Conricerca is itself a practice of intellectual production that does
not accept a distinction between active researcher and passive research subject.
The con- or "co" is meant to "question the borders between the production of
knowledge and political subjectivity"[^roggero]  or, simply, to create a
productive cooperation that transforms both parties into active participants in
producing knowledge and in transforming themselves. More than anything,
conricerca is a political methodology; it is the methodology of a constituitive
breach[^roggero].

Militant research similarly, is, according to the Spanish women's group
Precarias a la Deriva (Precarious Women Adrift) "a process of our own capacity
of worlds-making which ..questions, problematises and pushes the real through a
series of concrete procedures"[^van-meter]. It is "research carried out
with the aim of producing knowledge useful for militant or activist ends" (Van
Meter, 2009). Both conricerca and militant research provide one with a set of
tools -- concepts, techniques, mechanisms -- that "contribute to existing
frameworks in radical movements by adding research components and by taking a
direct role in producing knowlelge and strategies that resonate with movement
campaigns, organisations and initiatives"[^van-meter-2]. Like Autonomist
theory generally, it is a focus on struggle from the perspective of struggle and
as such provides opportunities for communication within and between movements
thus widening the field of struggle. For example, the U of T Assembly has opened
up and connected previously disparate groups -- bringing into communication
those concerned with the strangulation of the humanities, those concerned with
the increasing corporatisation of science and technology research, those
concerned with labour issues within the university and those concerned with
mining issues half a world away.

In this way, academics have -- immanent to their daily work lives -- the tools
needed to transform institutions and to accelerate the generation of a more
autonomous university.The university is, itself, a political organisation, it
connects people and creates connectivities between people. Militant research
from within the university can push these new collectivities connected in the
institution to develp new practices -- both educational and political, outside
of the university. Militant researchers -- a proliferation of them within
faculties and departments especially -- can begin the arduous task of delinking
research and knowledge production from the power relations that currently define
the academy and capitalism. Militant or co-research can aid in understanding the
extent to which capitalism subsumes the common sphere of knowledge. This is
important, as it "provides a language that helps make visible and politically
problematic the progressive encroachment of circuits of capitalist accumulation
into more and more areas of social life and the parallel movement of
externalising more and more all the risks of entrepreneurial activity to workers
(through flexibilisation and precarisation) and to living beings as such
(through negative externalities such as environmental degradation)"[^nunes].

As noted, militant research uses already existing capacities and it built into
the organisation of the university, but its fundamental presupposition is to do
and be more. But it must be said that while I -- as an academic invested in the
university -- am not reducible to my institutional relations or positions, I
cannot ignore the fact that my institutional affiliations introduce certain
problematic biases or practices into my work. As it currently exists, the
university is not entirely compatible with a programme of militant research and
because of this incompatibility our first faltering steps at radicalising and
making larger militant research endeavours may fail. Accepting this and then
recognising that, if we are committed to a project of transforming and creating
the autonomous university we must continue to push at the borders of this
incompatibility until we can collectively -- as newly produced knowledge
subjects -- break through them. This is not a problem unique to our endeavour in
the university -- any worker who attempts to make of their waged labour
something other than the pure production of surplus value will come up against
these incompatibilities. Working through them is the only way forward.

### Liberating our Knowledge ###

Finally, the third proposal for the autonomous university to come: I am also
optimistic about the capacity of academic radicals to pose robust challenges to
the property regimes that enclose, capture and sell the work that we produce.  I
am encouraged by recent attempts to take on the corporate giants that now
control the vast majority of academic journals. Their exorbitantly expensive
(and therefore decidedly prohibitive) pay-per-use fee structures profoundly
limit the kinds of publics that are able to access this work. Today,
universities and other (often public) institutions find themselves in the
paradoxical position of both paying for the production of academic work only to
turn around and buy it back from the corporate publishing houses that print it.
Thus under conventional publishing models, our universities are "required to pay
for the research costs, associated salaries of researchers as well as
subscriptions to the journals where this is ultimately published, while also
often signing away the control of these publications."[^carys]
Given the absurdity of this scheme, it is encouraging to see that some journals
have begun to try and make their exit from this particular racket. I think that
the self-conscious efforts of relatively new journals like Human Geography -- a
new journal put together by radical geographers and available for a small fee on
the web -- and Feminists@Law to exit this standard arrangement -- either through
publishing the work independently or by offering articles through an online
open-access format - demonstrate laudable commitment to scholarship that
challenges capitalist hegemony in both content and form. The capacity of
particular journals to begin to make this kind of exit is, of course, almost
entirely contingent on particular kinds of technological innovation that have
made publishing itself relatively user-friendly and allow papers to be
circulated without the prohibitive cost of actually printing them.

Nevertheless, there are a number of significant barriers that make the move away
from corporate publishing challenging. I'd like to highlight two in particular.
The first is that the work of publishing a journal is -- even in spite of the
above-mentioned user-friendliness of contemporary publishing programs -- an
enormous undertaking. I have been involved in the production of a bi-annual
academic/activist journal over the last few years (*Upping the Anti: A Journal
of Theory and Action*) and have learned first hand the staggering number of
labour hours required to put it together. Even with an editorial board of close
to ten individuals -- each working on the project for roughly ten hours a week
in addition to attending at least one evening meeting -- we routinely only
barely manage to pull together the final product before deadline (usually
through herculean last minute efforts). My point is that the production of even
the most basic of journals requires an enormous range of invisible tasks -- from
solicitation of material, to organizing writers and reviewers, to the final
stages of production, and so on.

<blockquote class='pull'>
	As we cannot escape -- there is no outside to the capitalist paradigm -- we
	must struggle work within in capital for its eventual overthrow.
</blockquote>

The second is that -- whether we like or not -- academic employment is still
largely contingent on publishing in venues that are recognized as legitimate. So
while our solidarities may lie with a given independently produced or open
access journal, the reality is that our livelihoods may well force us to pass
them up in favour of recognized "leaders" in the field. How does this get us
closer to the autonomous university then? I think that both of these problems
could be substantially mitigated if a number (initially just a few) of well
established journals were the first to terminate their relationships with
corporate publishers. There are a number of well-established journals with
strong disciplinary reputations that could well be sympathetic to these kinds of
arguments. We might be able to make significant headway by encouraging the
editorial leadership of sympathetic journals to lead to take a new direction
when their agreements with corporate publishers come to a close. The exit of
these established journals could begin to open space for others to follow suit.
But the question of infrastructure remains a central one. In order for this
challenge to be met, new networks might need to be established. Here, we might
imagine groups of journals coming together to build centralized production
houses, design templates, etc. They might also be able to use their
institutional leverage to re-imagine and remake how information is distributed.
Universities, for example, might be convinced that their resources are better
used housing particular journals -- covering the costs of basic production --
than simply paying a corporate publisher to access them.

These three proposals simply sketch the beginnings of what could make up the
autonomous university. To be certain, they may at first blush appear to be
reformist changes, tweakings of the already existing relationships at play
within the contemporary university, but I hold that these changes are the
necessary ones that can prefigure the autonomous university to come. As we
cannot escape -- there is no outside to the capitalist paradigm -- we must
struggle work within in capital for its eventual overthrow. The practices that I
propose here -- and I am always thinking about and working on more -- are all
experiments in how the autonomous university could be, how we can make it
together. I encourage our friends and comrades and teachers and students to take
seriously these proposals and begin the creation of the autonomous university
from where you are, from within, right now.
