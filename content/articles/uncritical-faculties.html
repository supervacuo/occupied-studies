description: If university students are offered the pernicious choice of resembling either products or consumers, what are the fundamental choices facing today's university professors? Are the practices of our professors in line with their preaching? Uncritical Faculties questions the apolitical attitudes and self-serving poises found among many professional academics today.

I am increasingly frustrated by the deluge of articles by tenured professors
explaining why it is an act of lunacy for anyone to go to graduate school in the
humanities. I decided that it is about time that the academy hears what one of
those lunatics thinks, and it's probably past due for them to hear why I am fed
up with their opinion on the matter.

According to Professor William Pannapacker in a Slate article last summer, what
is needed to combat the ever-dwindling number of tenure-track positions in the
university is for humanities programs to start preparing students for "real
careers" outside of academia by focusing on internships and networking
"Overeducated, Underemployed: How to fix humanities grad school." Slate July
27, 2011.[^1] I think his misguided opinion on the matter perfectly
illustrates how the problem has gotten so bad. It apparently has never occurred
to Professor Pannapacker that this type of instrumental logic is precisely why
humanities programs are devalued in academia. Ostensibly he's arguing that if a
program doesn't prepare students for "real careers" in the real world of
capital, then it is failing its students. This is the verbatim rationale that
has been used to squeeze out expensive tenure professor positions and replace
them with cheap graduate student or contract labor. In other words,
Pannapacker's solution to the problem is the problem. Worse yet, one of his
potential remedies is for graduate students and professors to simply leave the
university in order to show administrators that they are unhappy with the state
of humanities research. If Professor Pannapacker cared for humanities research
as much as he claims he does, he would not be so cavalier about giving up on it.
Unfortunately, the good professor is not the only one of his ilk who has lost
touch with the nature of this problem or its only real potential remedy. I would
like to submit an alternative analysis of the crisis that so many professors in
the humanities appear to be concerned with, but have as of yet been incapable of
or unwilling to articulate properly. With that, I'll provide a solution that I
feel is more concrete, and certainly more likely to produce sustained viability
for university research and education than any of the available proposals.

It would be shortsighted to blame all of our problems on university
administrators who continually demand more profitable research from professors,
and saddle faculty with massive numbers of undergraduate bodies to teach and
fewer resources with which to do so. That is, of course, part of the problem.
Or at least it would be part of the problem if it weren't for the fact that
these administrators are making demands on a body of people that happen to be
amongst the most highly educated citizens in their respective countries. Amongst
many public universities, professors have been able to maintain some degree of
union strength. In the universities where unions are absent, the institution of
tenure affords professors considerable free speech protections, especially
regarding their right to speak out on issues of public importance. Now, in
light of this new information, it is hard for me to place blame squarely on the
shoulders of the profiteering university administrators, when in fact there is a
group of people who far exceed administration numbers, are potentially better
organized, and have the institutional protections to openly question university
policies. To put it bluntly, professors have much more power than they or
university administrators are willing to admit, and I'm not afraid to say that
it makes them complicit in the erosion of higher education.

Just this last year, at my institution in Canada, the faculty union defeated the
administration in contract negotiations because it was widely believed that the
university was attempting to erode the strength of tenure. A full-fledged
resistance was launched; much of the public relations language expertly
articulated the universal understanding of the crisis in academia. At this
rather conservative university, the faculty union was able to unite and defend
themselves against an administration that threatened their professional
autonomy. At the beginning of this last fall semester, the faculty also
successfully defended the academic librarians who were forced to strike over the
administration's insulting wage demands. Why was this possible?  It's no secret
that the administration, any university administration, is outmatched against a
professorate that is united in their stance, especially when they have garnered
the support of other groups of people in the university. But sadly, this is as
far as the fight has gone. It's true, tenure may be saved for those that
already have it or those that may be in line to immediately receive it, but
tenure as such is dangling by a thread, as is the future of higher learning
itself. And it is not the administrators that stand poised to hang us, but our
own mentors who have failed to acknowledge how tenure is being passively
eliminated through the back door. The problem then, if it is not already clear,
is not the university administration alone, but rather the complacent,
disorganized, disillusioned, and self-involved professors in the academy who
have lost their revolutionary spirit, who have turned the other cheek rather
than resist, who have retired to the safety and comfort of departmental
obscurity, and who have thus traded away the security of future generations of
scholars in order to solidify their spot in the Ivory Tower.

I am not alone in this assessment of the situation. I will guarantee that the
armies of graduate students struggling to stay afloat know who is to blame. So
too for the contract lecturers and instructors. The grim job prospects have
forced many to stay quiet out of fear that they will hurt their potential to get
a tenure position when that times comes (perhaps the definition of academic
irony?). Many professors I know despise the neoliberalization of the university
as much as I do, they have fought administrations on these very terms, and they
understand that exploitation of graduate students is getting worse, as is the
demand by administrators to constantly increase graduate and undergraduate
enrollment. More and more teaching falls onto contract lecturers and other
precarious laborers, but for whatever reason, no one seems willing to take a
stand that is not directly related to their own immediate well being.  There is
no need to discuss this problem amongst ourselves indefinitely: we do not need
to organize a conference to discuss possible solutions, and we certainly should
not consider throwing up our hands in frustration, as though the powers that be
have already won. The stakes are too high. What we need is for the professors
of the academy to use their positions to help rescue the university from the
corporatist, profit logic of neoliberalism by openly and actively resisting
further encroachments by administrators. The Occupy movement has established a
new foundation for resistance, and the next logical step is for this movement to
spread to university campuses. Allow me to provide a rough sketch of potential
action.

1. What is needed first, unfortunate as it may be as a first step is for faculty
to decide whether or not the university is a business, or an institution of
learning; it can no longer be both of these things at once. It has served as a
convenient scapegoat for tired professors, who carefully walk the line between
business and criticism depending on their needs at the moment. The university
has to be either a space of intellectual exploration and free thought, or it is
a factory in which students show up and exchange money for a degree. The
inconsistent hypocrisy of university faculty on this matter has been nothing
short of appalling. Treating the academy as both a business, whose sole purpose
is profit, and also an institution of unbound and critical reflection charged
with transcending the ideologies of capital, race, gender, and sexuality, is
counterintuitive and unsustainable. It works only in the interest of university
administrators who have capitalized on the myths of what the university used to
stand for, in order to fill the lecture halls and attract donors; it has led to
the situation we find ourselves in at the present moment. 
2. Assuming that the hard truths regarding how we lost our way can be
magnanimously accepted, the next step is organization. Faculty, graduate
students, post-doctoral fellows, undergraduates, university employees, contract
lecturers, and whomever else is inclined should begin at once to hold general
assemblies in order to identify what role the university ought to be playing in
society and the current barriers to its fulfillment. This I believe will lead to
an erosion of the hierarchical barriers between the involved actors, and will
help us all identify what we desire from one another so that we may all help
each other realize our common goals. Foremost, we need to stop thinking about
what we can do, or are allowed to do, or what we can afford, or what we have
done in the past, and instead we need to focus on what it is we believe the
university is supposed to be about, and work from that position and that
position alone. 
3. The final step should be to provide administrators with the assembly's
grievances, and the ways in which they can be rectified. The ultimate goal
should be to wrestle control of economic resources and sole decision-making
authority out of the hands of administrators, whose instrumental reasoning and
profit motives are turning the university into a diploma factory, made possible
through the exploitation of graduate student and contract labor. Obviously, I
don't believe that the administrators will be receptive to the idea of
relinquishing power to a general assembly. Faced with this inevitability, all
should be prepared to hold a series of peaceful demonstrations, strikes,
walkouts, and occupations, in order to disrupt all university business for as
long as it takes to regain some level of control and autonomy. 

I realize I put myself at considerable risk publishing this polemic. True, the
fear of alienating myself from the very faculties I seek to join would appear to
be reason enough to stay quiet, but if someone doesn't speak up soon, there will
be no university to protect. At my institution, our faculty is spread thin
amongst a cadre of admittedly needy graduate students, so much so that they are
now attempting to justify the refusal of reference letters and committee
obligations. This is unacceptable. More graduate students will be accepted
next year no doubt, but there is already no funding for conference travel. My
willingness to speak out illustrates that the situation has gotten so bad for us
that as graduate students, we are no longer concerned about the possibility of
getting a tenure track position. In my eyes, tenure is already gone. Maybe
academic freedom will be next?  After that, what's to stop them from eliminating
all of the unpopular or unprofitable subjects? Claiming "institutional
pressures" was an excuse that worked for the professorate as long as the next
generation of graduate students believed there was still a university to go to.
We once believed we could defer university activism until after tenure. Let
this be the unofficial notice that we no longer believe that. There is indeed a
crisis in academia, which is not debatable. But the point at which it can still
be saved is upon us. The methods I propose perhaps seem radical, but I implore
you, if we consider what is at stake, if we fail to save the very foundation of
thought, then we should all hang our heads in shame for what we've allowed to
happen.
