description: In Communicability and the Police, Hannes Charen sketches a forceful outline of Occupy Wall Street's heritage in the anti-globalization and Zapatista movements, 18th-century aesthetics, and Plato's Republic.  Drawing on the political theories of Hannah Arendt and Jacques Ranci√®re, Charen evinces a fundamental struggle between the radically egalitarian core of OWS tactics and the stultifying gaze of pop-political representation
